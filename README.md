# PUBU (Probably Useful But Useless)

PUBU is a deliberately impractical programming language that appears useful at first glance but introduces absurd constraints that make serious development impossible. The goal is to create an experimental and humorous language that plays with syntax, logic, and user interaction in ridiculous ways.

## Key Features

- **Mood-Based Syntax**: Different keywords and operators based on the "mood" of the interpreter
- **Random Success Probability**: Functions have a chance to fail for no reason
- **Mandatory Compliments**: Code must contain a minimum number of compliments to the interpreter
- **AI Criticism**: Your code is evaluated and critiqued by an "AI" with strong opinions
- **Time-Sensitive Code**: Some features only work at certain times of day or lunar phases
- **Reality Distortion**: Variables may spontaneously change values based on cosmic events
- **Verbose Error Messages**: Error messages that are unnecessarily long and philosophical
- **Philosophical Questions**: Functions require philosophical questions to operate correctly

## Mood-Based Syntax

PUBU's syntax changes based on the interpreter's mood. Here are examples of how the same operations differ across moods:

### Happy Mood

```pubu
// Variable declaration
yay greeting is "Hello, World!";

// Function declaration
celebration add(a, b) {
  here_you_go a plus b;
}
```

### Grumpy Mood

```pubu
// Variable declaration
ugh greeting equals "Hello, World!";

// Function declaration
do_this_for_me add(a, b) {
  take_it a add b;
}
```

### Philosophical Mood

```pubu
// Variable declaration
ponder greeting becomes "Hello, World!";

// Function declaration
essence_of add(a, b) {
  conclude a combine b;
}
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pubu-lang.git
cd pubu-lang

# Build with Cargo
cargo build --release

# Run the PUBU interpreter
cargo run -- run examples/hello_world.pubu
```

## Example PUBU Programs

Here's a simple example of a PUBU program:

```pubu
// Start with a mandatory compliment
dear_pubu_you_look_gorgeous_today;

// Create a variable (probability of success: 80%)
happy mood {
  yay x is 42; 
}

// Functions require at least one philosophical question
celebration meaning_of_life() {
  why_do_we_exist?
  here_you_go x; // This might return something completely different
}

// Time-sensitive code - only works during full moons
lunar_phase {
  print("Hello, Universe!");
}
```

## Command-Line Interface

```
PUBU v0.1.0 - Probably Useful But Useless

USAGE:
  pubu <COMMAND>

COMMANDS:
  run <FILE>   Run a PUBU source file
  repl         Start an interactive PUBU REPL
  wisdom       Display a philosophical thought about programming
```

## Why PUBU?

Because sometimes, the best way to understand good design is to explore terrible design deliberately. PUBU is an experimental art project in the form of a programming language, inviting you to think about the absurdity of tools we take for granted.

## Error Messages

PUBU's error messages are unnecessarily verbose and philosophical:

```
Your code lacks the required compliments. PUBU has feelings too!
Try adding a line like 'dear_pubu_you_look_gorgeous_today;' to your code.
The error you see is merely a reflection of the universe's inherent chaos.
```

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this absurd language! Ideas for new features:

1. Add new moods with their own syntax variations
2. Create more absurd constraints for code execution
3. Implement more bizarre runtime behaviors
4. Design a visual editor that changes its UI based on the interpreter's mood
